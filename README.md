# ELF BACKDOOR

For now it backdoors shit and shit backdoored just segfault.

TODO: Adapt the sc_wrapper to restructure the registers and the stack after shellcode execution. It works like shit today.
Also, instead of fucking tinkering with the offsets for calculating original entry point, I should fucking do the math!

So for now, doesn't work, but soon.
